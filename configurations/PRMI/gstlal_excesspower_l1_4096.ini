; Maximum NDOF -- setting this will enforce that the tile will not exceed a certain area. This will override the time and frequency resolution settings

; Fix NDOF -- setting this will enforce that the tile area is constant across all resolutions, though the width and height will change. Example, base-resolution=8 implies that the duration will be 1/16, and higher levels will multiply the resolution by 2 and decrease the duration by 2, but the area will always be the same
